## Overview
Citibike is a bike-sharing service that provides a convenient commuting option for tourism in New York City. This project involves analyzing Citibike's data to prepare a business proposal for a bike-sharing system in Des Moines. By taking a bike-sharing dataset from August 2019 in New York City, we can manipulate the data using Jupyter Notebook and utilize Tableau to make insightful visualizations for potential investors.
