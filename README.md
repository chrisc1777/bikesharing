## Overview
Citibike is a bike-sharing service that provides a convenient commuting option for tourism in New York City. This project involves analyzing Citibike's data to prepare a business proposal for a bike-sharing system in Des Moines. By taking a bike-sharing dataset from August 2019 in New York City, we can manipulate the data using Jupyter Notebook and utilize Tableau to make insightful visualizations for potential investors.

### Checkout Times for Users

This line graph shows how many hours were bikes checked out by all riders. Although some bikes are checked out for several hours, most bikes are returned within five minutes of being checked out.


### Checkout Times by Genders

This line graph categorizes the checkout hours by gender. There are more male riders than female riders, but there are too many unknown values to classify a significant difference between the two.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

This heatmap shows the relationship between start-time and stop-time by hours. The busiest checkout times occur from 5 pm - 6 pm during the week, with the busiest happing on Thursday. The least busy times occur from 3 am - 4 am on weekdays.
